# HTML Notepad Projects Collection

This repository contains my earliest web development experiments (2022-2023).  
I created these mini projects using **Notepad only**, without any frameworks, templates, or editors — just pure HTML and basic inline CSS.

These small experiments helped me understand:
- HTML structure
- Inline styling
- Basic layouting
- Web page elements and forms
