This repository contains my very first HTML experiments, which I created in 2022 using only Notepad, without any frameworks, editors, or developer tools. These projects helped me understand the fundamentals of web development, including HTML structure, tables, forms, layout, simple CSS styling, and visual imagination.

They may look simple, but each one represents an important step in my learning journey. These projects show where I started before moving on to more advanced technologies such as Visual Studio, C#, ASP.NET, and Unity.
